## ðŸ§± OOP Design

### âœ… Classes

- `Product` (abstract)
  - `ExpirableProduct` (adds expiry logic)
  - `ShippableProduct` (implements `ShippableItem`)
  - `ExpirableShippableProduct` (both expirable and shippable)
  - `NonExpirableProduct` (like digital products)
- `Customer`
- `Cart` & `CartItem`
- `CheckoutService`
- `ShippingService`

### âœ… Interfaces

- `ShippableItem`  
  ```java
  public interface ShippableItem {
      String getName();
      double getWeight();
  }
